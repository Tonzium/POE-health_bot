# Path of Exile, Health Bot
This project consists of a sophisticated script designed to enhance the gaming experience in Path of Exile by directly reading the game's memory to track the player's health status.
Utilizing reverse engineering techniques, this script monitors health points, mana, and energy shield levels in real-time. When it detects that the player's health is critically low,
it automatically administers a health potion, ensuring the player stays alive.
